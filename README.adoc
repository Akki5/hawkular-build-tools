= Hawkular Build Tools

Contains resources used during the build of other Hawkular projects:

* Configuration for Checkstyle in `src/main/resources/hawkular-checkstyle` directory

Also contains IDE configuration files. Import these in your IDE so your IDE can
format files according to Hawkular style rules.

* ide-configs/eclipse - Eclipse preferences for code style. The names of the files
                        in here indicates where you should import these files.
                        e.g, hawkular-eclipse-preferences-java-codestyle-cleanup.xml
                        should be imported in Preferences > Java > Code Style > Cleanup.
